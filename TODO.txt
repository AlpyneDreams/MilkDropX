- Try https://github.com/OfficialIncubo/BeatDrop-Music-Visualizer - it's really definitive even if it has some annoyances, it seems like the definitive version
	- We'll see though...
	- Might be better to just have authentic sauce
- Port this straight into vitamin as a DLL
- Scour all of these for presets

Evaluation of versions
	MilkDrop2			My goat. Would be a pain to decouple from winamp
	Incubo's BeatDrop		Seems bloated but might be the best one. Active development so could contribute stuff too.
	BeatDrop			Quite a mess but has been easy to fix up decently so far
	BeatDrop2077			French garbage. Not updated. Worth looking at changes though
	MilkDrop3			French garbage. Not open source. Overengineered dogshit
	WACUP MilkDrop2			Coupled with winamp and also highly specialized for their shit
